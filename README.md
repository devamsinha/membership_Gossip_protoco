Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1 -  offered by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

Gossip Protocol is a communication protocol, it is process computer to computer communication that works on the same principle as how information is shared on social networks. Nowadays, most of the systems often use gossip protocols to solve problems that might be difficult to solve in other ways, either due to inconvenience in the structure, is extremely large, or because gossip solutions are the most efficient ones available.

The modern distributed systems use this peer to peer gossip protocol to make sure that the information is disseminated to all the members in the network. Gossip protocol is referred to as Epidemic Protocol as it disseminates or spreads the data the same way as an epidemic spreads a virus in a biological habitat.
